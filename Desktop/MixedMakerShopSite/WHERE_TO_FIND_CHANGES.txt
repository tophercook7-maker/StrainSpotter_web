WHERE TO FIND THE CHANGES
=========================

The changes were made to the "What I Make" section (also called "Makes" section).

LOCATION IN YOUR FILE:
----------------------
1. Scroll to the section with heading "What I make" 
   - Look for: "3D prints, keychains, and tiny problem-solvers"
   - This is around line 2506 in index.html

2. In that section, find the large card on the RIGHT SIDE that shows:
   - A large emoji/image (🏷️)
   - Below it, a box with text about "visual anchor"

WHAT CHANGED:
-------------
The box that says "A visual anchor for anything that ships out of the studio, from prints to lures"

BEFORE: 
- It was positioned OVER the image (absolute positioning)
- It looked like it was hiding content
- Small text, hard to read

AFTER:
- It now sits BELOW the image (static positioning)  
- Much more visible and readable
- Has an orange title "MixedMakerShop Product Tag"
- Better spacing and styling

TO SEE THE CHANGES:
-------------------
1. Open index.html in your browser (double-click the file)
2. Scroll down to the "What I make" section
3. Look at the RIGHT SIDE - you should see a card with:
   - Image/emoji at top
   - Information box below it (NOT overlapping)
