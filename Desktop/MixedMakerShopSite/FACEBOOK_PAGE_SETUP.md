#### Post 2: About the Studio
```
MixedMakerShop started as a place to put all the projects that didn't fit anywhere else: a useful print here, a clever script there, a keychain idea that felt too fun to ignore.

Over time, patterns showed up—some of those projects wanted to be real products or tools.

That's how Henry AI, StrainSpotter.app, and GoneFishin Keychains came to be. All under one roof: the 3D printing, the code, the physical and digital systems.
