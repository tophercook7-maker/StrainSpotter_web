I've filled in the form with:
- ✅ Page Name: **MixedMakerShop**

## Next Steps in Browser

Since Facebook requires authentication and may have additional security steps, here's what to do:

### Step 1: Complete the Form
The form should already have:
- Page Name: MixedMakerShop
- Category: Business Service

If there's a **Bio field**, paste this:
```
MixedMakerShop – a tiny studio turning ideas into things you can hold and use: 3D prints, Henry AI, StrainSpotter.app, and GoneFishin Keychains. One studio, many small ventures. Visit: mixedmakershop.com
```

### Step 2: Click "Create Page"
Click the "Create Page" button to proceed.

### Step 3: After Page Creation
Once the page is created, you'll be able to:
1. Upload profile picture
2. Upload cover photo  
3. Fill out About section
4. Add website link
5. Create first posts

## All Content Ready

I've created `FACEBOOK_PAGE_CONTENT.md` with:
- ✅ All text content ready to copy-paste
- ✅ About section content
- ✅ Initial post templates
- ✅ Image specifications
- ✅ Complete setup checklist

## Image Assets

You'll need:
1. **Profile Picture** (170x170px) - M3 logo
2. **Cover Photo** (1640x859px) - Branded design with tagline

I can help create these images if you'd like, or you can use your existing m3-logo.svg.
