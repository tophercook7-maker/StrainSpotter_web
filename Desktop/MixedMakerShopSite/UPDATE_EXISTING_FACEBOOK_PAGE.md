   A tiny studio turning ideas into things you can hold and use: 3D prints, Henry AI, StrainSpotter.app, and GoneFishin Keychains.
   ```

4. **For Long Description, paste this:**
   ```
   MixedMakerShop started as a place to put all the projects that didn't fit anywhere else: a useful print here, a clever script there, a keychain idea that felt too fun to ignore. Over time, patterns showed up—some of those projects wanted to be real products or tools.

   Instead of scattering them across random sites, MixedMakerShop is the studio and umbrella. When a project wants to become a venture—like Henry AI, StrainSpotter.app, or GoneFishin Keychains—it still lives under this roof. That keeps everything connected: the 3D printing, the code, the physical and digital systems.

   This is where everything starts. Some ideas stay as one-off projects; a few become their own named venture with a clear audience and purpose.

   Visit mixedmakershop.com to see the whole picture: what we're making, why we're making it, and how small experiments turn into things you can actually hold, use, or build a business around.
