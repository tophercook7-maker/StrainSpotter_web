HOW TO ADD YOUR KEYCHAIN IMAGES:

1. Place your keychain photo in this folder (img/things/)
2. Name it: keychain1.png (or .jpg, .jpeg, or .webp)
3. The image will automatically appear on the website

Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP

Example filenames:
- keychain1.png
- keychain1.jpg
- keychain2.png
- etc.

IMPORTANT: After adding images, you need to:
1. Re-upload the entire gonefishinkeychains folder to Netlify
2. Or update just the img/things/ folder if you know how

The image will show automatically once uploaded!
